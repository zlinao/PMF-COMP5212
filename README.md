# PMF-COMP5212
##dataset:
- we use the MovieLens 100K dataset to evaluate the performance of PMF. The dataset consists of 100,000 ratings from 943 users on 1,682 movies.
## PMF model
-Matrix factorization (MF) is one of the most commonly used approaches in all sorts of recommender systems (e.g., for book recommendation, music recommendation, and friend recommendation).the learning of PMF with MAP estimation is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared errors with quadratic regularization terms. The sum of squared error score responds to the likelihood term and the zero-mean spherical Gaussian priors correspond to the regularization terms.
